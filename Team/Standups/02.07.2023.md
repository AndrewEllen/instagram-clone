### What I did yesterday

Yesterday I worked mainly on the HomeScreenCard widget. This widget is used to show posts on the home screen.

### What I'm doing today

Today I've been working on the HomeScreen page. I added an appbar and a listview.builder widget to generate content on the home page.

I will also be working on moving over to the new KanBan board
