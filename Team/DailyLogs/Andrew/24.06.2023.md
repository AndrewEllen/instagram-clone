### What I did today
- Went over coding conventions with Lewis. Both agreed on it.
- Went over code of conduct. Both Signed it.
- Made sure we both had access to everything.
- Setup Trello and the backlog
  - Prioritised the tickets with high, medium and low priority.
  - Added subtasks for each ticket.
  - Added a timeline for getting each ticket done.
- Agreed on mvp.

### What I learned


### What my plan going forward is

- Get the footwork done for the apps base UI (Navbar, Appbar etc).
- Get auth functionality in.

### Things to look at

- Firebase realtime database. Might be better for this project than the firestore one.
