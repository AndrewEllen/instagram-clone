### What I did today

- Had a standup meeting with Lewis where we showed off our work the previous day.

- Today I worked on the profile screen.
- I got the basic UI looking nearly identical to Instagrams own.
- I added a share profile button that opens a modal with options of where to share.
- I added an edit profile button to change username and display name.
- I aded a tab bar to change between tagged posts, own posts and own videos.


### What I learned

- I learned the fractionalbox widget is really useful for when you need a box that takes up a percentage of the screen


### What my plan going forward is

- I plan on implementing dummy data for the posts screen on the profile
- I'm going to create the search user page with dummy data


### Things to look at
