### What I did today

- Today me and Lewis worked on switching over the Kanban board. We went from using Trello to using ClickUp.

The reason for this change is because of a few factors. Clickup lets us use proper swimlanes for the tasks but it also lets us setup Epics, Story points and Tasks correctly.

On top of these reasons it also allows us to accuratly set the time tasks are expected to take in hours, time ourselves doing the task, set deadlines and see team work load. It allows us to properly manage the project and for me to properly manage the team.
