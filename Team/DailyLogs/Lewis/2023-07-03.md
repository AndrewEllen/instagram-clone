### What I learned

Encountered an issue: 'RenderFlex overflowed by X pixels on the bottom issue on the `LoginPage`'. This was fixed by wrapping the contents of the page inside a `SingleChildScrollView` widget.

This change makes it so that the content is scrollable when there isn't enough 'vertical space' for all the widgets, removing the Renderflex Overflowed issue I had.

### What my plan going forward is

Look into a pipeline for the project
